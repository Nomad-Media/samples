## Step 2

Open the folder in vscode. You should see the same file contents as above.

Go to asset_uploads.py and run the code. It should ask for your authentication token. To find out how to generate you authentication token go [here](https://github.com/Nomad-Media/samples/blob/main/nomad-samples/js/account-authenticaton/Readme.md). Enter your authentication token into the terminal.

## Step 3

To upload a file, first enter the display name for your asset. If you leave it blank, it will default to the name of your file. Then, enter the upload overwrite option you want to select. Replace replaces an existing asset, continue continues the upload of an asset that is currently uploading, and cancel cancels the upload of an asset that is uploading. Then, enter the file path, related content id you want to add to the asset, and whether or not you want to use multi-thread upload.
